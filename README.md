This is my repository for my etch-a-sketch project! It's going to be a lot of fun!

My goals for this project are:
- to get it working
- to complete the bonus tasks
- to make it look somewhat good

I will practice a lot of javascript skills while doing it, so it should be a lot of fun!

# reflection
This project was a lot of fun. I enjoyed getting to use my new skills. One of the harder things was having event listeners not automatically call their functions, but I was able to wrap them in anonymous functions and the problem went away. I will be very interested in learning exactly why that works.

I didn't complete the bonus tasks according to their specifications, but I did add additional functionality that I believe makes the program more useful (ie. getting to pick your color). There's a slight issue with the drawing mechanism where if you move your mouse too fast it won't track, but I believe that's just a limitation of javascript and event listeners, and I really don't want to figure out how to change that, because it works well enough now.
